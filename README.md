I am analysing an Indian based hardware production company
The excel file provided has 5 worksheets and it can't be saved in CSV file format that way
So, I created 5 seperate CSV files and used one for each worksheet as i linked them above
Then I used SQL to create a table for each CSV file and import them there
Then I linked the SQL database I created to Tableau Desktop
I used tableau desktop to visualise the data
